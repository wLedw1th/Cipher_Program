# Cipher_Program
Cipher Python Script for Digital Security Lesson on Cryptography.

This program seeks to be a demonstration of different methods of cipher encryption and decryption.

The program handles all logic internally, acting as a black box for the user. 

This is all programmed in a CLI space, but a version using a Tkinter GUI will be available soon :)
